# Drafts

This is where I keep posts that are not completed yet. Making them public makes collab easier and also makes sure that the work put into perpetually incomplete posts is never _entirely_ lost.

That being said, I stand beyond _none_ of what's in draft posts. Sometimes I write what I _think_ is correct, and verify it later. In particular, I sometimes find out I was wrong through peer/lit review. If you read a work in process, know that this is my process.
