## Alan Watt's Hyperbole

The quote above is taken from an [old recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoVPZjfcHFQ) of the great thinker and self-styled philosopher Alan Watts. I couldn't have been older than fifteen when I first heard it, and yet, it left a deep impression. Not because of the mathematical epiphanies that, in hindsight, it resonates so well. (My career focus at the time was being a pothead high school dropout, which left little time for developing my capacity for the abstract.) It was the idea that everything affects everything else to the extent that every single thing, in the marks left on it by existence, carries the entire world upon it.

About a hundred years before that (how many exactly, it is hard to say), a succession of great thinkers noticed a curious type of geometry called _hyperbolic_. The hyperbolic geometry cannot be embedded in our universe. It has its own weird rules where triangles _always_ admit less than 180 degrees, and, to Euclid's dismay, for each line L and point p not on L, one can find _infinitely many_ lines parallel to L that go through p.

The hyperbolic geometry cannot be embedded in our space, but it can be _drawn_, just not to scale. One nice way to do it is a nice model called the [_Poincar√© disk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model) (though it is commonly credited to [Eugonio Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami), as is often the way in math). The model is very simple.

First, draw a circle:

The points of our geometry are those _inside_ the circle. In particular, they _do not_ include the points _along_ the circle. This is what we call an _open disc_. The lines along the circle are called its _boundary_, and they somewhat correspond to a "circle at infinity". Now, say that we chose two points in our geometry:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We want to draw a straight line between these two points, but we want the line to be straight in the _hyperbolic geometry_. Since the drawing is not up to scale, a straight line in the hyperbolic geometry is _not_ necessarily straight in our normal, Euclidean geometry. (This is no different than longitude _lines_, which are straight lines on our round earth, but become arced when drawn on a world map.)

The recipe for finding the line going through two points is simple: of all the (everyday Euclindean) circles that go through the two points, there is exactly one that intersects the boundary circle at right angles. This is the straight line we were looking for.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

More generally, straight lines are exactly those constructed this way: by taking a segment of a circle that intersects the boundary at right angles. (Note that sometimes that "circle" _is_ a straight line, this happens exactly when it passes through the center of the disc).

To better understand this eerie geometry, we can _tessellate it_. Just like we can cover the plane with identical squares, we can also do it with the plane. The result will be something like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A square tessellation of the Poincare disc, created by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353970526_Limitations_on_Realistic_Hyperbolic_Graph_Drawing">David Epstein</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Amazingly enough, all of the above squares are _congruent_. Not only do they have the same area, but the exact same shape!

A more interesting way to do so is to start with a _zero-degree triangle_, a triangle whose sides only meet on the boundary at infinity. The result is arguably much more aesthetic:

Building on these ideas, one can create a wealth of beautifully intricate Tessellations. The aesthetics was not lost on artists of the time, such as M. C. Escher, who is possibly the reason all of this feels oddly familiar.

The pursuit to understand the symmetries of these weird new geometries soon led to a startling realization. Imagine we only take _two_ such symmetrical moves. Now, I know that's hard to imagine, since _what these symmetries might look like_ is far from obvious, but bear with me. The point is that we take these two symmetry-preserving moves, and now we repeat them many times, in whatever order we want. We also allow ourselves to apply these symmetries _backwards_ (e.g., if one of the symmetries is a quarter turn clockwise, then we are also allowed to apply quarter turns counterclockwise). We can now start with a _single point_ on the plane, and trace how it jitters around as we use more and more symmetries.

In many cases, this is not a particularly interesting experiment. But it turns out that if we choose the symmetries _correctly_, we will note something interesting: for some of the possible starting points, and some of the possible sequences of applying our symmetries, we will find that the starting point does not escape to infinity, or repeats itself in an infinite pattern, but it is instead _attracted_ to a particular position on the hyperbolic plane. Such positions are called _attractors_, and it turns out that the set of all attractors of two given symmetries can hide striking beauty. Just like the reoccuring reflections of the same object on two of Indra's Pearls can hide the entire complexity of existence. It can be as simple as a circle, or complex enough that, despite being a curvy line, it fills the entire hyperbolic plane!

Indra's Pearls is the story of the journey to discover these symmetries. Masterfully told by some of the conductors of the cutting-edge research in the 80s and 90s (I mean seriously, Google David Mumford). It starts from the basics and builds its way through the patterns, beginning with "tame" symmetries of reflecting distant balls through each other, and progressing to exploring the space of all "fractalous" choices of two symmetries, discovering that this space itself is an intricate fractal of fractals! Giving new substance to Indra's metaphor by recognizing that in their application, the "pearls" themselves are literal spheres!

I am not aware that Alan Watts himself was aware of the striking mathematical analogy between the powerful metaphor he found in the Aatamaska Sutra and the astute observations of great mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Bernhard Riemman, Friedrich Schottky, or Felix Klein. But I feel safe to assume that he didn't.&#x20;
