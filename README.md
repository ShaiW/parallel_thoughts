# Parallel  Thoughts

This website is a substitute for [my blog on the Functor Network](https://functor.network/user/912).

While I appreciate the latter's complete LaTeX engine, it is much less friendly when it comes to embedding pictures or managing cross-references.

I will not import my old posts.

Some of the posts here will eventually be processed into [Proof-of-Work: the Book](https://shai-deshe.gitbook.io/pow-book), while others have a more general scope.
